# About

This repository contains a small workshop to work with [Frege](https://github.com/Frege/frege), a [Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org/) implementation for the JVM. Its main purpose is to teach functional programming in order to improve basic skills in this area which then can be reused when writing [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) code.

## Where to go now?

This workshop is split into single **sessions** with each having its own documentation in the [doc/](https://github.com/christophpickl/JohnFrege/tree/master/doc) folder.
